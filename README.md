# Will They Stay or Leave Predicting Customer Churn with Logistic Regression

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting **customer churn** using **Logistic Regression**.  
Customer churn prediction is a critical task for businesses, especially in the telecom, SaaS, and subscription-based industries, as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

## Project Overview

The notebook explores how machine learning techniques—specifically **Logistic Regression**—can be applied to predict whether a customer is likely to **stay** or **leave**.  

Key steps covered:
- Data loading and exploration (EDA)
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- Splitting data into training and testing sets
- Building and evaluating a Logistic Regression model
- Generating insights and visualizations to interpret results
